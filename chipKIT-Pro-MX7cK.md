The chipKIT Pro MX7cK, also formerly known as the Cerebot MX7cK, has two methods of programming:

1. Using the on-board hardware debugger
2. Using the standard [[chipKIT Bootloader]]

Using the on-board hardware debugger requires the installation of [[MPLAB-X]] and the configuration of [[mdb.jar]] in UECIDE.

If you want to use the bootloader but you don't have it installed at the moment (using the on-board hardware debugger will have removed it) you can reinstall it using the on-board hardware debugger using the [[Bootloader Plugin]] in UECIDE.
