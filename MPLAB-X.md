**MPLAB-X** is the full-blown PIC32 (and other PIC family) IDE from Microchip.  It offers full debugging of all the PIC chips.

If you need debugging then MPLAB-X is what you should be using. There is a certain amount of integration between MPLAB-X and UECIDE thanks to the MPLAB-X [[UECIDE Plugin]].

MPLAB-X can be downloaded from [http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/)
