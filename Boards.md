UECIDE has support for many many boards.  Some of them are very straight forward to work with. Others, though, require special instructions and knowledge to get the most out of them. That may be special ways of programming, certain additional software or libraries, and so-forth.

chipKIT Boards
--------------

There are a few chipKIT boards that need special instructions or have extra facilities you should know about:

[[chipKIT Pro-MX7cK]]

4D Systems Boards
-----------------

4D Systems have one board at the moment, the [[Picadillo-35T]] which is a 3.5" TFT screen with built-in PIC32MX795F512L and a chipKIT Uno32 footprint.  It requires [[DisplayCore]] for controlling the TFT screen.
